# template_matching

## Validation project for [Fahla.nl](https://www.fahla.nl/) 

### I have to implement a Python application that finds the most similar region in a given large image with an specified small query image in less than 200 ms.
### I used template_matching module in opencv for this project.
### Al last I dockerized this application.
